[WIP] What this does
==========
Chrome extension that highlights fake news links. Inspiration and data on fake domains come from https://github.com/bs-detector/bs-detector - this project is basically a rewrite of that to be more performant and more of a focus on Reddit.

Todos:
- generate proper warnings
- figure out how to handle ajax, iframe, pagination etc
- figure out how to handle short urls
